## Physical Description
Kosvak Truebeard bears the unmistakable mark of his Dark Iron heritage. His skin, the color of weathered stone and ash, speaks of long years shaped beneath the weight of rock and the glow of molten fire. From deep within his bloodline blaze a pair of ember-bright eyes — not merely red, but alive, like sparks held in the dark — glimmering with cunning and resolve. Heavy brows cast his expression in a permanent shadow of stern appraisal, though those who endure his gruff presence come to know the truth: behind the hard exterior rests a steady hand, a loyal spirit, and a sly wit as sharp as metal striking the anvil.
A broad, rugged nose and deeply lined features lend him the hardened visage of one tempered by trial, yet his countenance carries the quiet charm of endurance rather than cruelty. His beard and mustache, thick as forged iron and black as smoldering coal, drape his face in braids reminiscent of the chains and tools of the forges he calls home. What hair remains atop his head is drawn back into a short, practical tail, the rest long since surrendered to time, hardship, and battle’s demands.
Of average height for his kin yet built with the immovable strength of quarried stone, Kosvak bears the stocky, muscular frame of a dwarf shaped for strife and survival. Every scar, every cord of muscle tells the tale of a life spent between the hammer’s strike and the mountain’s silence — unyielding, indomitable, and unbroken, as only a Dark Iron can be.


## Personality Traits
Bold of heart and bright of spirit, Kosvak Truebeard carries the restless soul of an adventurer. Ever drawn to distant horizons and the tapestry of strange lands, few of his kin possess his rare thirst for discovery and the mingling of cultures. This boundless curiosity forged an unbreakable bond between him and the venerable Explorers’ League—an alliance of seekers and sages devoted to uncovering the world’s hidden truths.
Kosvak’s calling as an investigator leads him into shadows where peril lurks at every turn. Though danger often brushes close, his many trials have tempered caution without quelling valor. Never one to leap blindly into the fray, he nevertheless meets every mystery with unwavering resolve, unraveling secrets others fear to face.
His probing mind also finds delight in the wonders of engineering — each peculiar gadget, whirring cog, or arcane contraption a spark to his imagination. Such marvels are not mere curiosities but keys that unlock the deeper mysteries of creation, and for Kosvak, every trinket tells a story waiting to be heard.

## History
In the shadowed forges of Khaz Modan, where the ring of hammers upon stone heralds every dawn, was born Kosvak Truebeard, in the year 25 Before the Dark Portal (BDP). His cavernous home, Kharanos, thrived with the proud legacy of the Truebeard clan — sturdy miners to their marrow. Kosvak’s father carved deep into the earth, seeking its secrets, while his mother, a Dark Iron dwarf and learned researcher for the League of Explorers, unraveled mysteries above and below. Their fateful meeting amidst the ruins of Grim Batol blossomed — a union forged in adventure and sealed with love in the very heart of Ironforge.

From infancy, Kosvak grew steeped in tales of lost empires and hidden veins of gold. By lantern and rune, he followed his parents through twisting tunnels and forgotten halls, learning to read not just books but the very language of stone and shadow. His world expanded beyond clan and kin, as he became fast friends with the ingenious gnomes of Gnomeregan, marveling in their city’s whirring mechanisms and clockwork wonders. Long were the days spent peering over blueprints and tinkering beneath pipework, his thirst for knowledge ever unquenched.

As Kosvak’s beard grew thick and his hands skilled, war-chimes sounded across the land. The Black Portal yawned, spilling forth the orcish Horde. Kosvak, oath-bound by tradition and duty, joined the Engineering Division of Ironforge’s stalwart army. Not for him the clash of blade on shield; instead, he toiled amidst gears and boilers, forging the lifelines of supply that sustained the resolute Mountaineers at the frigid fronts of Dun Morogh.

The Second War brought new trials. Kosvak soared through smoky skies atop gyrocopters, thundered across battlefields in clanking fighter planes, and braved death’s embrace for the iron halls of his people. For valor, the division crowned him with a Medal of Merit. Promoted, he took command of tank companies, melding dwarven stubbornness with mechanical fury against the enemy’s siege.

With time and tide, the Third War called. Kosvak voyaged far, setting foot upon untamed Kalimdor, where dwarves and men stood shoulder to shoulder against the shadow. Here, fortune granted him kinship with Gilnean engineers, their wit as sharp as their spanners. Bonds formed in battle endure long beyond their flame: after the war’s bitter end, Kosvak was welcomed in Gilneas, a land behind guarded gates. There, the call of mystery beckoned stronger than that of cannon or forge.

Under the tutelage of Halford Ramsey, famed investigator, Kosvak unraveled crimes with grit and guile, aiding the Gilnean constabulary as a shrewd apprentice and stalwart friend. From moonlit alleys to noble manors, he learned the art of discerning truth from falsehood, of chasing secrets through shadows.

Years passed, and once again Ironforge’s bustling streets echoed to the sound of Truebeard’s boots. Hardened by war and tempered by experience, Kosvak carved a new future for himself—as a private investigator, promising justice for those forgotten by law and fortune. In the smoke-filled corners of dwarven taverns and between shadowed alleyways, his reputation grew, drawing the attention of Dirk Swindle, a notorious broker known to pull the strings from behind the scenes in both Ironforge and Gadgetzan. With Swindle’s quiet backing and a knack for opening doors best left closed, Kosvak’s agency took root—its reach extending from the iron halls of Ironforge, through the sun-blasted markets of Tanaris, to the snowbound outposts of Everlook.

Wherever mysteries unfold, Kosvak Truebeard is never far: a dwarf with a mind as keen as the finest axe, a heart steadfast as Khaz Modan’s mountains, and a beard that does justice to the name. To meet him on the trail of adventure is to know that every puzzle has its solver, and every secret its seeker.
