## Physical Description
Kosvak is a tanned-skinned dwarf with fiery red eyes, inherited from his Dark Iron ancestry. He has thick eyebrows, drawn together in an eternal air of disapproval, that deceive on first contact. Actually, the dwarf is a friendly being, always willing to talk and tell jokes.
His nose is bulbous, potato-like, with a bushy black beard and mustache. His hair is virtually non-existent on top of his head, he ties what's left into a practical ponytail.
Kosvak is the average height of an adult dwarf, with a stocky, muscular build.

## Personality Traits
Confident and optimistic, Kosvak is a natural adventurer. Always interested in traveling and discovering new cultures, he has a curiosity that is little manifested in his race, but this connected him in an interesting way with the Explorers League.
His job as an investigator puts him in dangerous situations, which made him cautious but not a coward. Taking no immediate risk to his life, Kosvak will always seek to delve into the mysteries presented to him, without reservation.
His inquisitive nature also sparked an interest in engineering, with any odd trinket or contraption fascinating to the dwarf.

## History
Kosvak Truebeard was born in the year -25 of the Present Era, city of Kharanos, in Khaz Modan, Dwarf Kingdom, Eastern Kingdoms. His father was a miner in the Truebeard clan and his mother a Dark Iron dwarf, researcher for the League of Explorers.

Kosvak was always curious and made friends among the people of Gnomeregan, going several times to the gnome city to learn more about engineering and machine design. Eventually, the dwarf enlists in the engineering division of Ironforge's army as a recruit. At this time, begins the first Orc invasion by the Dark Portal, culminating in the First War.

The engineering division awards him his first Medal of Merit for bravery in combat. Kosvak is promoted to First Class Soldier and begins to learn about ground combat machines, being transferred to the tank company.
When the Third War breaks out, Kosvak and the engineering division go to Kalimdor. There, the dwarf meets several Gilneans, coming from the engineering troops of the humans and ends up making several friends among these people. Returning from the war, Kosvak goes to Gilneas, where he becomes interested in the investigative profession. There he meets his mentor, Halford Ramsey, who teaches him the ins and outs of investigating mysteries. Kosvak participates in several cases, assisting Ramsey and the Gilnean police.
After a few years, the dwarf returns to Ironforge and establishes his own agency. Kosvak then partners with Mindse Darkwrench, owner and commander of the Strongale Company, which sponsors and funds Kosvak's agency.
